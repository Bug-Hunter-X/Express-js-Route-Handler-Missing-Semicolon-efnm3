This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error in Express.js route handlers: a missing semicolon after a response.  The `bug.js` file showcases the error, where a 404 response is missing a crucial semicolon. This can cause unexpected behavior or prevent subsequent code from executing correctly. The `bugSolution.js` file shows the correct implementation with the semicolon added, resolving the issue.
